Signaling, and jargon talk incoming, prepare yourself
**************************************************************

It's 2014, and a thought comes. It's time to get serious about money. I
will finally give Bitcoin a chance. Ok, I need Bitcoin habits. First
habit: Read every day `r\/bitcoin`_ for 2 minutes. Next, buy `Andreas
Antonopulos book Mastering Bitcoin`_. 50 pages later my mind blew away!
Since, I'm haunted by Bitcoin obsession in my professional, and personal life

First part of the page highlights important projects. Second starts with CV.
It's long and boring list of things I worked on. You will get an idea about my
experience, and expertise.

Takeaway
========

 - With better tools in your environment your ability will be higher. This will 
   lead to doing more which will in turn give you more actual skills. Then
   it will be easier to do that behaviors in future even without tools.

This is a story about role of environment in our behavior. It's written
through my personal journey. Lot if it can be looked like and is bragging.
**Hope is though that you will get some useful info out of it.**
For not geeks to understand this article here are crude definitions of
technologies. They are all free and open source technologies:

- Ubuntu: Linux Operating System (OS) for PCs built for regular people.
- VSCode: text editor with very easy learning curve and many great extensions.
- Arch Linux: Linux OS for die hard geeks and hackers with hard learning curve.
- VIM: text editor for die hard geeks and hacker with hard learning curve.

Accidentall success
=====================

It's year 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto just gave birth to Bitcoin. It's third
semester at my University journey. I'm more happy about running Ubuntu then
learning. Most importantly, slowely but surely, I'm on path to say good bye
to my childhod developmental trauma.

As I breath more fully I'm more open to new experiences. Soon after friend of
mine suggests and helps me install Arch Linux OS. It's the coolest operating
system for wannabe hacker at the time. Cool thing about it is that you have
to construct it by yourself. Like Lego's. 

This was huge change! Until that moment my knowledge about Linux like
OS was more theoretical then practical. That started to change
because everything I wanted and needed for my assignments I
had to setup by my self. That meant a lot of tries and errors, and getting
hands dirty to actually understand the underlying technologies and concepts.
That process is and was very painful and frustrating at times. **But I had no
fallback computer**. I gave away my laptop to parents. More accidentally
though, then purposely to change environment.

**Success** was sticking with Arch for first year. That only happend **because
there were no fallback**. After that my skills were much better and sticking
with all the housekeeping that needs to be done when running Arch was not a
big deal.

On journey of 8 years with Arch I got a lot of good stuff. Most importantly
skills and knowledge about tools, concepts and ecosystem of applications in
general. But also insights about different Free and Open Source Software --
FOSS -- community cultures and benevolent dictators. On the bad side, I
formed some half baked opinions and values. Mostly held dogmatically as would
describe well my personal development at that time. Which can be summarized
as: open source is the only way to go. I was missing that **these are just means
in bigger fight for values in this universe.**

Analysis of behaviors, tools, skills and environment
====================================================

Before returning to values. Let's see how can we understand our behavior. For
that we need a model. Best model out there is `Fogg Behavior Model`_ **FBM**. FBM
says **Behavior** happens when **Motivation**, **Ability**, and **Prompt**
come at **the same time**. Prompt says do the thing now! There is connection
between Motivation and Ability which is **Action Line**. If combination of
Motivation and Ability is bellow Action Line when Prompt happens there will
be no Behavior.

Lets take for example donating to your favorite charity. If somebody asks you
to donate 1000$, and you don't have that money with you or it is too much for
you. Your Ability will be very low and if you don't have huge Motivation you
wont do that Behavior. But if they ask for 10$ and you want to do it, and you
have the money with you, Behavior will happen. The take a way here is that
Motivation is like a wave. It comes and goes, everybody knows that. But where
great idea is, is that **by making things simplier or more easy to do we
don't have to rely on Motivation.**


Simplicity changes Behavior
------------------------------

Or in other words anything which will boost your abilities will change your
behaviors. So how can we increase our abilities you ask?

* by training person so that his skill increases
* by simplifying action with starter step or with tiny version
* by **putting a tool or resource in person's environment**


Tools are important
--------------------

More important then you think
-----------------------------

With better tools or resources in your environment or context your ability
will be higher. This will lead to doing more which will in turn give you more
actual skills. Then it will be easier to do that behaviors in future even
without tools. And in different environments.

That is the reason why I'm very deliberate about everything in my environment.
And why I switched Arch Linux for Ubuntu. And VIM for VSCode. And why I
bought three different chairs, and a standing desk, and so on. I'm sure that
the benefits of having more stable OS and text editor with such an easy
learning curve, great user experiences, and powerfull exttensions will
increase my skills even more. As they already did.

This ideas about behavior desing comes from `Standford professor 
BJ Fogg`_. This is a `tiny part of BJ's work`_ go and learn everything about it
will change your life forever! `Preorder his book on Tiny Habits`_.

Let's fight! Back to values
=============================

I started with Bitcoin because it is really important. **Bitcoin is as
important as Internet is.** That's why I'm steering my carrier in Bitcoin
direction. Important thing about it is what are the values of people that created
it? What does it represent? What does it enable people to do?

Here are some of these values:

* Right to privacy

* Freedom of expression (which money is form of)

* Right to alternative neutral economic system

* Censorship resistance

* The sovereignty of individual

* Fighiting chance against digital age dictatorship



Bitcoin isn't created in vacuum. It was built on shoulders of giants.
Most technologies used to create Bitcoin come from cypherpunks culture.
And `cypherpunks write code\!`_

Conclusion
===========

If you are dealing with some form of trauma. Please first help your self. Ask
for help, and treat yourself kindly. Use this new found knowledge.

For the rest of us, this is a call to action. We should collectively 
always strive to make our environment better. So we don't have to be saints
to do the right thing. Lets use this new knowledge about behavior, find good values to
fight for, form strong opinions on most important things. Act in good faith.
Live life worth living. Be willing to change when reason tells us. Live long
and prosper. ðŸ’—

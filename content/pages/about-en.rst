Marijan Svalina is not a good writer. `Sam Harris
<https://samharris.org/>`_ wrote `five bestsellers
<https://samharris.org/books/>`_.  When Harris says: `"Okaaaay. A little
housekeeping" <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6LLanVCt-M>`_.  Marijan gets joyful. 
Then he thinks what would `Jordan B. Peterson
<https://jordanbpeterson.com/>`_ say on that in his dramatic voice: "Dragons
are real, but they are also fun when they are small! If you ignore Dragon
long enough, he grows and destroys your house. `Roughly speaking
<https://youtu.be/X88pcqzt8lo>`_... `Clean your room! Bucko!
<https://youtu.be/6YJ8cCgkkig>`_

Marijan is not a great programer, although programing is his vocation.  Nor is
he a Bitcoin expert, although it's his great passion. Marijan is not funny,
although he tries very hard. Marijan is not englightned, although he talks
non-stop about meditation.

Operating system in Marijan's mind is upgraded mostly by, you're gusssing,
Harris and Peterson (More by Harris!). And for other big upgrades the blame is
on `Yuval Noah Harrari <https://www.ynharari.com/>`_, `Andreas M. Antonopulos
<https://aantonop.com/>`_ and `Saifedean Ammouse <https://saifedean.com/>`_.


Marijan is jack of all trades, and master of none.

Marijan is always searching to be with heartful wisdom while standing at the
edge of order an chaos.

Marijan is also not a great runner. But this is cool photo of him.

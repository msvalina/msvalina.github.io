Mission
=======

  - Every day I hope that what I said, wrote, did and how I live my
    life that it helps others (and me):
  - a) **to overcome life challenges** or at least **lessen unnecessary
    suffering** and:
  - b) **to feel adequate** for our life,
    in this moment, here and know; even when we don't think that our selves.


Vision
=======

 - Help everyone who wants (and myself) to **understand why** and  **feel love**,
   compassion, for all **life**, with all experiences negative and positive.

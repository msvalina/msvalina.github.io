TLDR
=====

* With better tools in your environment your ability will be higher. This will 
  lead to doing more which will in turn give you more actual skills and
  it will be easier to that behaviors in future even without tools.
* With Arch Linux the focus was to learn the building blocks of Operating
  System (OS).
* With Ubuntu focus is not on OS but on solving other problems.

This is a story about role of environment in our behavior. It's written
through my personal journey. Lot if it can be looked like and is bragging.
Hope is though that you will get some useful info out of it.

Accidentall success
=====================

It's year 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto just gave birth to Bitcoin. It's third
semester at my University journey. I'm more happy about running Ubuntu then
learning. Most importantly, slowely but surely, I'm on path to say good bye
to my childhod developmental trauma.

As I breath more fully I'm more open to new experiences. Soon after friend of
mine suggests and helps me install Arch Linux OS. It's the coolest operating
system for wannabe hacker at the time. Cool thing about it is that you have
to construct it by yourself. Like Lego's. 

This was huge change! Until that moment my knowledge about Linux like
OS was more theoretical then practical. That started to change
because every thing I wanted and needed for my assignments I
had to setup by my own. That meant a lot of tries and errors, and getting
hands dirty to actually understand the underlying technologies and concepts.
It was very painful and frustrating at times. **But I had no fallback computer**.
I gave away my laptop to parents. More accidentally though, then purposely to
change environment.

**Success** was sticking with Arch for first year. That only happend **because
there were no fallback**. After that my skills were much better and sticking
with all the housekeeping that needs to be done when running Arch was not a
big deal.

On journey of 9 years with Arch I got a lot of good stuff. Most importantly
skills and knowledge about tools, concepts and ecosystem of applications in
general. But also insights about different Free and Open Source Software --
FOSS -- community cultures and benevolent dictators. On the bad side, I
formed some half baked opinions and values. Mostly held dogmatically as would
describe well my personal development at that time. Which can be summarized
as: open source is the only way to go. I was missing that **these are just means
in bigger fight for values in world.**

Analysis of behaviors, tools, skills and environment
====================================================

Before returning to values. Let's see how can we understand our behavior.
For that we need a model. Best model out there is Fogg Behavior Model.

Tools are important

More important then you think
-----------------------------



Let's fight - Back to values
=============================

New values

Let's fight

Ubuntu not arch

Strong opinions

cypherpunks write code

Focus on writing more then learning

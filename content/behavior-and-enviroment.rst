TLDR
=====

* With better tools in your environment your output will be higher. This will 
  lead to doing more which will in turn give you more actual skills and
  it will be easier to that behaviors in future even without tools.
* With Arch the focus was to learn the building blocks of Operating System (OS).
* With Ubuntu focus is on solving other problems.

This is a story about role of environment in our behavior.

It's year 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto just gave birth to Bitcoin. It's third
semester at my University journey. I'm more happy about running Ubuntu then
learning. Most importantly, slowely but surely, I'm on path to say good bye
to my childhod developmental trauma.

As I breath more fully I'm more open to new experiences. Soon after friend of
mine suggests and helps me install Arch Linux OS. It's the coolest operating
system for wannabe hacker at the time. Cool thing about it is that you have
to construct it by yourself. Like Lego's. 

This was huge change! Until that moment my knowledge about Linux like
OS was more theoretical then practical. That started to change
because every thing I wanted and needed for my assignments I
had to setup by my own. That meant a lot of tries and errors, and getting
hands dirty to actually understand the underlying technologies and concepts.
It was very painful and frustrating at times. But I had no fallback computer.
I gave away my laptop to parents more accidentally then purposely to change
environment.

BILJEŠKE
========



I got some half formed opinions and half backed ethics. Better half backed then none.
Mostly because of my lack of general knowledge in ethics.


Some dogmas that I hold on to then:

I need to cone

Goal

Cilj mi je pokazati kako znam modele i metode mjenjanja ponašanja




ne informirano mišljenje

bojanje od kodiranja


stavovi izrađeni

vrijednosti utemeljene

ne više fokus na učenje

nego pisanje

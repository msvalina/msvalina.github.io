Here is a list of my formal experiences and informal learning, education, and
projects. It's ordered by what is most valuable to me. Formal stuff is
written in more professional tone, while informal in more causal.
You will get an idea about my experience, and expertise.

Informal learning and projects

Signaling, and jargon talk incoming, prepare yourself

It's 2014, and a thought comes. It's time to get serious about money. I
will finally give Bitcoin a chance. Ok, I need Bitcoin habits. First
habit: Read every day `r\/bitcoin`_ for 2 minutes. Next, buy `Andreas
Antonopulos book Mastering Bitcoin`_. 50 pages later my mind blew away!
Since, I'm haunted by Bitcoin obsession in my professional, and personal life

Running full nodes
-----------------------------------------

* Bitcoin full node on rpi (bitcoind)
* Lightning network node on rpi (lnd)
* Bitcoin and Lightning testnet nodes.

Nodes are behind NAT. They will be soon public. Always trying to learn more
about applied cryptography tools and understanding. On next ATH one more
Raspberry PI and Monero full node is online.

Models and methods about behavior. Models explain how behavior works. Methods
how to design behavior for change.
The best money -- 899$ -- I've ever spent! Even better then Bitcoin at 100$.

Master's Thesis: 3D model reconstruction with 3D camera
-------------------------------------------------------

3D model reconstruction using 3D camera is a process that relies on a few
complementary technologies. This thesis presents a developed application for
triangle mesh reconstruction from acquired point cloud. The thesis also
examines quality and functionality of the de- veloped method by
reconstructing few 3D models of objects and scenes. Scene recording is
performed using RGBDSlam application with a Microsoft Kinect camera. RGBDSlam
controls acquisition of RGB-D images and assembles point cloud representing
the observed 3D scene by fusion of the acquired images using SLAM technique.
The Program is based on ROS framework and OpenCV library. The obtained point
cloud is used for 3D mesh re- construction using developed program
mesh-reconstruction. The program is based on PCL library which contains an
implementation of Poisson algorithm for mesh reconstruction. It has a
graphical user interface developed in Qt which features functions for
downsampling and removing outliers from captured point clouds, it also oers
Poisson parameters configuration and has functions for reconstruction and
visualization of constructed triangle mesh. 

Technologies:

* C++, Poisson, Qt Kinect, point cloud, 3D modelling, RGBDSlam, ROS, OpenCV, SLAM,
  PCL

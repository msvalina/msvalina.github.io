Master's Thesis: 3D model reconstruction with 3D camera
-------------------------------------------------------

3D model reconstruction using 3D camera is a process that relies on a few
complementary technologies. This thesis presents a developed application for
triangle mesh reconstruction from acquired point cloud. The thesis also
examines quality and functionality of the de- veloped method by
reconstructing few 3D models of objects and scenes. Scene recording is
performed using RGBDSlam application with a Microsoft Kinect camera. RGBDSlam
controls acquisition of RGB-D images and assembles point cloud representing
the observed 3D scene by fusion of the acquired images using SLAM technique.
The Program is based on ROS framework and OpenCV library. The obtained point
cloud is used for 3D mesh re- construction using developed program
mesh-reconstruction. The program is based on PCL library which contains an
implementation of Poisson algorithm for mesh reconstruction. It has a
graphical user interface developed in Qt which features functions for
downsampling and removing outliers from captured point clouds, it also oers
Poisson parameters configuration and has functions for reconstruction and
visualization of constructed triangle mesh. 

Technologies:

* C++, Poisson, Qt Kinect, point cloud, 3D modelling, RGBDSlam, ROS, OpenCV, SLAM,
  PCL

&lt;li&gt;Update 25 Mar 2020. In the mean time I did &amp;quot;finish&amp;quot; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/msvalina/jun-a-k"&gt;React Django GraphQL app&lt;/a&gt; for

&lt;li&gt;Update 25 Mar 2020. In the mean time I did &amp;quot;finish&amp;quot; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/msvalina/jun-a-k"&gt;React Django GraphQL app&lt;/a&gt; for
reporting wild dumps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="background"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's fall of 2015. Four years ago. I quit my job as Magento backend
developer. It lasted only three months... Preparation for position took
learning PHP for a year, and some months. On mornings before daily
programing job. But that is a different story. So I need a new job, but I
don't have to rush it. I'm thinking to myself. Let's build simple workout app
for exercise routine I'm doing. Let's build it with some new technology that
will help me land a new job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="app-and-technology"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;App and technology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Workout routine for app is from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.startbodyweight.com/2014/01/basic-routine-infographic-poster.html"&gt;StartBodyweight.com&lt;/a&gt;, it's simple and
good for beginners starting bodyweight exercises. It's based on this infographic poster.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.startbodyweight.com/2014/01/basic-routine-infographic-poster.html"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Start bodyweight poster" class="align-center" src="https://msvalina.org/assets/images/startbodyweight-com-poster.jpg" style="width: 75%;" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web is not going anywhere. JavaScript is not going anywhere. I should orient
toward them, is my thought stream. It's new beginning and I'm choosing
to learn new â€” as some would describe â€” revolutionary technology. It's
React â€” A JavaScript library for building user interfaces â€” invented at
Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it is with paradigm shifts, new tech, best practices are not
established for some time after invention. And in React case from start it is
explicitly minimal in nature. Also, Facebook did not lead the way at the time
with supporting frameworks, tools, and practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That left a lot of space for enthusiast developers to fill the gaps needed to
make complete application with React. &lt;strong&gt;Explosion of boilerplates code
happened.&lt;/strong&gt; Small frameworks that provide scaffolding code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many questions in front of me. Can I build something useful only
with React? Which boilerplate to choose? Should I build only client side
application? Why not build backend in JS also? I should go with express,
right? How good is that MongoDB that everyone is talking about? Why not use
JSON Web Token for authentication? Why not use Server Side Rendering to speed
up loading time? What about latest ECMA script standard? Of course I should
use webpack, right? And so on...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These questions lead me to try and experiment with different approaches.
A lot of research, and not so much development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="result"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Result&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent two and a half months on project. On backend side, we can say that
minimal viable product, working API is done. It support users, authentication,
progressions, progression entries, and workout sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the design side. What I have to show are this half baked wireframes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Start bodyweight app wireframes" class="align-center" src="https://msvalina.org/assets/images/sbw-wireframe.jpg" style="width: 95%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And from frontend there is almost nothing. I tried to use, many different boilerplates.
Started with simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;react + webpack + babel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1"&gt;react + react-router + react-hot-loader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then figured I wanted state management. I tried three different redux
implementations, with all latest bells and whistles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bdefore/universal-redux-jwt"&gt;universal-redux-jwt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/joshgeller/react-redux-jwt-auth-example"&gt;react-redux-jwt-auth-example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/erikras/react-redux-universal-hot-example"&gt;react-redux-universal-hot-example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that in the end I would settle on react-redux-universal-hot-example.
And my time expired because I got new job offer. Which I took.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="mistakes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mistakes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did I do so little?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of story can be describe as distraction...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Distracted boyfriend meme looking at new boilerplate" class="align-center" src="https://msvalina.org/assets/images/boilerplate-distracion.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the plan was to do everything by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that is also part of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I have time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had time, just not as much as I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ever present problem of estimation in software development...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to use every possible cutting edge technology at the time...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="leesons"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Leesons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New technology and fast results are not good combination.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy to underestimate complexity of simple applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&amp;amp;D is not development.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimum viable product. Repeat MVP, MVP, MVP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="on-javascript-fatigue"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;On JavaScript fatigue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many before me have identified this phenomenon as &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Javascript-Framework-fatigue-considered-a-big-problem"&gt;JavaScript fatigue&lt;/a&gt;. I
would not say this is that big of problem. Yes it would be easier if there
were standards, best practices and less choices.
But bigger problem in my case is that &lt;strong&gt;I was learning too many things at
once.&lt;/strong&gt; I'm not seasoned JavaScript developer. That meant, a lot of catching
up, and a lot of unsuccessful pitfall avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-did-i-get-from-all-this-boilerplates"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What did I get from all this boilerplates?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well I did actually bother to understand every boilerplate that I used. I did
my homework on understanding nodejs, express, mongoose, babel, on the backend side.
And on frontend side react, webpack, SSR, babel, redux. My head was not in the sand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's blast from the past. My broken truth with reflections. A way to draw
leassons from failed project. Showcase of my current abilities. Failed
showcase, but still. It should at least shed some light at my skill as
Frontend DevOps Engineer, or as failed Full Stack Developer. Thank you for
reading. Have a nice day. ðŸ’—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Takeaway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With better tools in your environment your ability will be higher. This will
lead to doing more which will in turn give you more actual skills. Then
it will be easier to do that behaviors in future even without tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

it will be easier to do that behaviors in future even without tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a story about role of environment in our behavior. It's written
through my personal journey. Lot of it can be &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.lesspenguiny.com/articles/best-article-on-bragging"&gt;looked like and probably is
bragging&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;strong&gt;Hope is though, that you will get some useful info out of it.&lt;/strong&gt;
For regular people -- not geeks -- to understand this article here are crude
descriptions of tools used. They are all free and open source technologies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ubuntu: Linux Operating System (OS) for PCs built for regular people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VSCode: text editor with very easy learning curve and many great extensions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arch Linux: Linux OS for die hard geeks with hard learning curve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VIM: text editor for die hard geeks with hard learning curve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img alt="VIM inside VSCode" class="align-center" src="https://msvalina.org/assets/images/vim-in-vscode.png" style="width: 85%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="accidental-success"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accidental success&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's year 2009, it's third semester at my University journey. I'm more happy
about running Ubuntu then learning. Around that time friend of mine suggests
and helps me install Arch Linux OS. It's the coolest operating system for
wannabe hacker at the time. Cool thing about it is that you have to construct
it by yourself. Like Lego's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was huge change. Until that moment my knowledge about Linux like
OS was more theoretical then practical. That started to change
because everything I wanted and needed for my assignments I
had to setup by my self. That meant a lot of tries and errors, and getting
hands dirty to actually understand the underlying technologies and concepts.
That process is and was very painful and frustrating at times. &lt;strong&gt;But I had no
fallback computer&lt;/strong&gt;. I gave away my laptop to parents. More accidentally
though, then purposely to change environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="My small room with PC, laptop and a bed." class="align-center" src="https://msvalina.org/assets/images/university-apartment.jpg" style="width: 85%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Success was sticking with Arch for first year. That only happened because
there were no fallback&lt;/strong&gt;. After that my skills were much better and sticking
with all the housekeeping that needs to be done when running Arch was not a
big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On journey of 8 years with Arch I got a lot of good stuff. Most importantly
skills and knowledge about tools, concepts and ecosystem of applications in
general. But also insights about different Free and Open Source Software --
FOSS -- community cultures and benevolent dictators. On the bad side, I
formed some half baked opinions and values. Mostly held dogmatically as would
describe well my personal development at that time. Which can be summarized
as: open source is the only way to go. I was missing that &lt;strong&gt;these are just
means in bigger fight for values in this universe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="analysis-of-behaviors-tools-skills-and-environment"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Analysis of behaviors, tools, skills and environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before returning to values. Let's see how can we understand our behavior. For
that we need a model. Best model out there is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.behaviormodel.org/"&gt;Fogg Behavior Model&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;FBM&lt;/strong&gt;. FBM
says &lt;strong&gt;Behavior&lt;/strong&gt; happens when &lt;strong&gt;Motivation&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Ability&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Prompt&lt;/strong&gt;
come at &lt;strong&gt;the same time&lt;/strong&gt;. Prompt says do the thing now! There is connection
between Motivation and Ability which is &lt;strong&gt;Action Line&lt;/strong&gt;. If combination of
Motivation and Ability is bellow Action Line when Prompt happens there will
be no Behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://www.behaviormodel.org/"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Meme - Well... thank you captain obvious" class="align-center" src="https://msvalina.org/assets/images/fogg-behavior-model-graphic-2019.webp" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take for example donating to your favorite charity. If somebody asks you
to donate 1000$, and you don't have that money with you or it is too much for
you. Your Ability will be very low and if you don't have huge Motivation you
wont do that Behavior. But if they ask for 10$ and you want to do it, and you
have the money with you, Behavior will happen. The takeaway here is that
Motivation is like a wave. It comes and goes, everybody knows that. But where
great idea is, is that &lt;strong&gt;by making things simpler or more easy to do we
don't have to rely on Motivation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="simplicity-changes-behavior"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Simplicity changes Behavior&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or in other words anything which will boost your abilities will change your
behaviors. So how can we increase our abilities you ask?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by training person so that his skill increases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by simplifying action with starter step or with tiny version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by &lt;strong&gt;putting a tool or resource in person's environment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tools-are-important"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tools are important&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img alt="Meme - Well... thank you captain obvious" class="align-center" src="https://msvalina.org/assets/images/thank-you-captain-obvious.png" style="width: 85%;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="more-important-then-you-think"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More important then you think&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With better tools or resources in your environment or context your ability
will be higher. This will lead to doing more which will in turn give you more
actual skills. Then it will be easier to do that behaviors in future even
without tools. And in different environments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the reason why I'm very deliberate about everything in my environment.
And why I switched Arch Linux for Ubuntu. And VIM for VSCode. And why I
bought three different chairs, and a standing desk, and so on. I'm sure that
the benefits of having more stable OS and text editor with such an easy
learning curve, great user experiences, and powerful extensions will
increase my skills even more. As they already did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ideas about behavior design comes from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.bjfogg.com"&gt;Stanford professor
BJ Fogg&lt;/a&gt;. This is a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.tinyhabits.com"&gt;tiny part of BJ's work&lt;/a&gt; go and learn everything about it
will change your life forever! &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.tinyhabits.com/book"&gt;Preorder his book on Tiny Habits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://www.tinyhabits.com/book"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Tiny Habits book cover photo" class="align-center" src="https://msvalina.org/assets/images/tiny-habits-book.webp" style="width: 75%;" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BJ's ideas did change my life. Because as most of us I also knew what would be
and what is good for me. But the problem was how to change habits. How to
change childhood conditioning. How to change lifestyle, how to make healthy
habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching to VSCode and Ubuntu is my way to sharpen my tools. To heighten my
abilities by changing environment. So I can work more successfully on things
that I value. Hope is that you also see the arguments for importance of tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all of us, this is a call to action. We should collectively
always be aware how our our environment steers our behavior and focus on
consciously designing it. So we don't have to be saints to do the right
thing. Live long and prosper. Thank you. Have a nice day. ðŸ’—&lt;/p&gt;

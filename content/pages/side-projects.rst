Values
*******

On the individual level from positive psychology perspective
`these are my Valuse in Action.`_

From larger society level these are dear to my heart and mind:

- Freedom of speech
- Right to privacy
- Radical Transparency / No lying
- Civil rights
- Rule of law
- Sovereignty of the individual

Informal learning and projects

Signaling, and jargon talk incoming, prepare yourself
######################################################

It's 2014, and a thought comes. It's time to get serious about money. I
will finally give Bitcoin a chance. Ok, I need Bitcoin habits. First
habit: Read every day `r\/bitcoin`_ for 2 minutes. Next, buy `Andreas
Antonopulos book Mastering Bitcoin`_. 50 pages later my mind blew away!
Since, I'm haunted by Bitcoin obsession in my professional, and personal life.

Models and methods about behavior. Models explain how behavior works. Methods
how to design behavior for change.

Since I also enrolled in `Tiny Habits Academy <https://www.tinyhabitsacademy.com>`_
and I will probably be certified Tiny Habits Coach.
Read more about some of my thoughts on behavior design in

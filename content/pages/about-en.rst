Marijan Svalina is not a good writer. `Sam Harris`_ wrote 
`five bestsellers`_. When Harris says: `\"Okaaaay. A little housekeeping\"`_.
Marijan gets joyful. Then he thinks what would `Jordan B. Peterson`_ say on
that. Jordan in his dramatic voice: "**Dragons are real, but they are also
fun when they are small. If you ignore Dragon long enough, he grows and
destroys your house.** `Roughly speaking`_... `Clean your room\! Bucko\!"`_

Marijan is not a great programer, although programing is his vocation.  Nor is
he a Bitcoin expert, although it's his great passion. Marijan is not funny,
although he tries very hard. Marijan is not englightned, although he talks
non-stop about meditation.

Operating system in Marijan's mind is upgraded mostly by, you're guessing,
Harris and Peterson. More by Harris. For other big upgrades the blame is on
`Yuval Noah Harrari`_, `Andreas M. Antonopulos`_ and `Saifedean Ammouse`_.

Marijan is jack of all trades, and master of none.

Marijan is also not a great runner. But this is cool photo of him.

Marijan is always searching to feel heartfelt wisdom. While standing at the
edge of order an chaos.

Marijan is still not a good writer. But you made it down here. Thank you.
Have a nice day. ðŸ’—
